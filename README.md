# TechInterview
This is the inception Technical Interview Project

Techstack: VueJS 2.0, Vuetify 2, and Vue CLI and NodeJS 16.20

To start, please clone the repository and run: npm i
Then run: npm install -g @vue/cli

You will then be able to start the project.

This project is intentionally broken. This project is to test your diagnostic skills for troubleshooting, and your creativity.

There is no right 'Way'. Just requirements. As you fix one issue, you will be presented with the instructions for the next task.

You are permitted to use anything at your disposal to complete the tasks.

Once complete, 
please commit to a new branch and email bhuff@inceptionllc.com and mglace@inceptionllc.com

I will stress, this does not need to be 'perfect'. This is just a gauge to determine how much training and time you will require to get up to speed.
